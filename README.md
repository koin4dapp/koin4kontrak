<h1>Player to Player Community Token</h1>
KOIN is DApp run on EOS block-chain to facilitate Player to Player interaction.

<h2>True Value Offering & Better than Any Offering</h2>
This is not an ICO activity, but an opportunity sharing offering. Members and Founder share the same value result, no free token distribute to Founder, all KOIN hold by founder came from his own fund and convert with same rate as other member.

Every EOS token collected is save securely at KOIN smart contract, and can be withdraw at any time. Deposit and Withdraw not depend on any Exchange; all functions are integrated in KOIN smart contract. Price is calculating based on current supply divide by total EOS in smart contract account.

Value result from member activity will distribute to all member immediately in term of token supply, which is directly impact to token price (Price=Current Supply/Total EOS).

Value sharing is come from percentage of surplus or deficit in each game session. In Dice, Free Dice, Free Wheel, TOTO, and Soccer, value sharing is 100% from surplus/deficit. In Lotto4x20, Lotto5x36, Lotto6x45, value sharing is 30% from surplus and 70% will go to jackpot prize pool. Surplus value will reduce token supply and Deficit value (after deducted from jackpot prize pool) will increase token supply.

<h1>3 Seeds Random Number Generator (3SRNG)</h1>
Our decentralized random number generators(DRNG) bring fairness and tamper-resistance in the process of generating numbers to ensure fair game to all members. To Ensure the fairness our DRNG using 3 random number seeds. The first seed is generated from player transaction to DApp, the second one is from previous session seed saved at DApp, and the third is from the blockchain it self. So there are no Founder intervention, all is happened automatically at the blockchain based on DApp algorithm. Code snippet:

```
void init(uint64_t initseed) { //second seed=last session seed
  auto s = read_transaction(nullptr,0);
  char *tx = (char *)malloc(s);
  read_transaction(tx, s);
  capi_checksum256 result; //32bytes of 8 chunks of uint_32
  sha256(tx,s, &result); //First seed=player seed=transactionid, fairness to player

  seed = result.hash[7];
  seed <<= 8;
  seed ^= result.hash[6];
  seed <<= 8;
  seed ^= result.hash[5];
  seed <<= 8;
  seed ^= result.hash[4];
  seed <<= 8;
  seed ^= result.hash[3];
  seed <<= 8;
  seed ^= result.hash[2];
  seed <<= 8;
  seed ^= result.hash[1];
  seed <<= 8;
  seed ^= result.hash[0];
  seed ^= seed ^= (initseed^(tapos_block_prefix()*tapos_block_num())); //Third seed=blockchain seed=fairness to all members
}
```

<h3>Pseudo Random Number Generator using SHA-256</h3>
The SHA-256 hash algorithm produces hash values that are hard to predict from the input. They are also roughly equidistributed as the input varies. The advantages of this approach for election auditing and some other applications include the following:
<ul>
<li>The SH-256 algorithm is public and many implementations are available in many languages.</li>
<li>Given the seed, anyone can verify that the sequence of numbers generated was correctâ€”that it indeed comes from applying SHA-256</li>
<li>Unless the seed is known, the sequence of values generated is unpredictable (so the result is hard to "game"). It is very hard to distinguish the output from independent, uniformly distributed samples</li>
</ul>

  return (uint32_t)((seed % to) + 1);

<h3>Possibility of Attack</h3>
KOIN token is player to player community DApp, so that we must make sure that 3SDRNG is secure from attacker can cause loss to all KOIN token holder. The key of target attack is in the 3 seeds. Actually there are no way to attack 3SDRNG from outside the blockchain using RPC API call.

The advanced attackers can try to make smart contract in order to attack our DApp. Their smart contract will can calculate our blockchain seed using tapos_block_prefix() and tapos_block_num(), but must make sure that the time between the attacker smart contract and transaction initialed by the smart contract must be run on the same block, otherwise the two numbers will be changed and the result is different. The code snipped:

```
auto seed3 = tapos_block_prefix() * tapos_block_num();
  ...
  ...
action(
  permission_level{_self, "active"_n,
  "targetcontract"_n, "targetaction"_n),
  std::make_tuple(_self, other params need by action)
.send(); 
```

(Source: https://bzdww.com/article/130403/, last access 8 June 2019)

Attack to our session seed is possible even though the table are not added to the ABI file, but advanced attacker can write smart contract to read it directly from the blockchain. They would typically create a struct and typedef similar to our singletone table, and read it using their smart contract. The code snipped:

```
struct similarobj {
  ...
}

typedef eosio::singleton <"targetobj"_n,similarobj> targetobj;

auto db = targetobj("targetcode"_n,name("targetscope").value);
auto seed2 = db.get();
...

```

Until now I don't found any reference from the web about how to get transaction ID before pushing transaction to blockchain, The transaction ID is the sha256 of the transaction structure in memory (see. read_transaction(tx, s)).

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
So far, we can made conclusion that our 3SDRNG is secure and ensure fairness to all members. If they have possibility to attack our DApp, but they are hard to do in smart contract.
